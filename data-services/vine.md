> The Utah Department of Corrections' VINE Service is a free automated hotline that provides victims and community members with offender information and notification 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

> Access to this data is available by using any touch-tone telephone. By entering the inmate's name or offender number, the caller can find out if the offender is in custody, and if the offender has a release date. If you have difficulty with the name or offender number you may access a VINE operator or contact the UDC Victim Services Unit for assistance.

You also may elect to receive notifications by email.
